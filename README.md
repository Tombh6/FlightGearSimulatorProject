# FlightGearSimulatorProject
 Advanced software programming project

This is a project we developed during our advanced software programming course in our 2nd year. This project helped us to gain a higher level of knowledge in programming, with emphasis on design patterns and programming principles, and finally developing our own JavaFX desktop application.

In this project we chose to use the **MVVM architecture**.

We have the View layer that is responsible for the presentation, for example the input from the user. The View is also responsible for producing the graphics and has the code- behind - for example, functions that are activated when we press a button, which are called event-oriented programming.

**Model** – Responsible for our business logic, such as algorithms and data access.

**View Model** – It passes commands from the View to the Model, and its purpose is to separate the View from the Model.

**Data Binding** – We can wrap variables such as those in the View, and then when we change something in the text, it will automatically changed in the ViewModel.



**Built with**:

Eclipse - Java IDE

Scene Builder - Scene Builder 8.5.0



**Additional software to run the program**:

FlightGear 2020.3
